# pixel-sorting #

I wanted to play with the Pixel Sorting tool at [ASDFPixelSort](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort), but do it in node.js. Because why not do it in JavaScript? 

Then I wanted to do it in TypeScript, so I updated it. 

## Usage ##

Standard node. First, install the packages with ```npm install```

Then, run the app with ```npm run pixel-sort``` to get the command line instructions.
