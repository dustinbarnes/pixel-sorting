# pixel-sorting #

I wanted to play with the Pixel Sorting tool at https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort, but do it in node.js. 

## Usage ##

Like all node apps, the first thing you need to do is get node. 10.x+ is required.

Then, you need to install the packages with ```npm install```

Then, run the app with ```node pixel-sort.js```
